A few weeks ago your anthill 
 was invaded by the spiders. 
###
   Both of you ran away in   
  search of another anthill, 
###
  and it seems like you have 
  finally reached it. But... 
###
it seems to have suffered the
     same fate as yours.     
###
 You can't run away for much 
       longer, though.       
###
You should stay, even if only
        for a night.         
###
  Maybe you could even help  
        those ants...
