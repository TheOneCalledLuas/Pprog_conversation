Once You realised that
  MerchAnt was only   
  Tricking you into   
######################
  Killing all those   
   innocent spiders   
  you confronted him. 
######################
  You killed him      
  with the minimal    
   pain for him.      
######################
  But yet you wonder  
  If he deserved it.  
    You think not.    
######################
  But yet you did the 
    right thing,      
       did you?       
######################
 You freed the anthill
 and stablished peace 
 between the spiders, 
######################
 And the ants, and    
 stopped the war lords
 Arachne and Merchant.
######################
   The bug wars have  
  come to an end, and 
the bugs celebrate it.
######################
They have an official 
meeting and choose you
   as their leader.   
######################
They all praise you as
their humble saviour, 
       and will
